                This game was based of the original version of Spellbreak which was in 3D and inspired me to make a 2D version because of its unique style and fun mechanics. 
                The way I started off my project was by creating a class based system for all the objects in the game. These objects included players, projectiles, obstacles, and consumables. 
                This way I could structure the game while maintaining flexibility if something new needs to be added to a class. Once I had the classes set up, the next step for me was to start adding 
                functionality as well as working with canvas. In the single player version, everything was going smooth. I was able to 
                create functional collision detections for all the objects, create event listners to listen for movement and mouse position, and to draw everything
                on the canvas in their correct position and angles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the game worked in single player, I wanted to try to make it multiplayer as it would be hard for 2 people to play on one computer. After this decision, 
                I learned that I had to restructure the whole architecture and assign roles to what the server should be doing 
                along with the client. To implement this communication I used Socket.io and Express. I set it up so that the client would listen to user events and share them
                with the server through designated sockets. The server would take that data, run it through the games logic, and then update the rest of the clients
                with a tick rate of about 33. This means it would be sending 33 updates per second. Finally, the client side would render everything using canvas for that specific client by using
                socket ID's. To make the game more interactive, I added animated sprites along with sound effects. I learned that having a proper arctecture when dealing wiht a full-stack application is 
                key for avoiding bugs and simpler coding.
