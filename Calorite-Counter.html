                With this project I tried to make an application that could connect to an external API to retreive relevant calorie information
                from different foods searched. Along with this I used Chart.js and React Calandar to assist the user in keeping track of how many calories
                they are consuiming on a daily basis. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This was one of my first projects where I used the React framework to design the structure of the site. I'm still pretty new to React so
                dealing with components and passing props felt a bit tricky at first. However, as the app was being fleshed out, I found that dealiong with
                components was an organized way of structuring an app. I could see how with larger projects this could prove to be useful but with smaller
                apps it felt a bit cumbersome. The external librairies I used also came with their own CSS so it was a learning experience on how I can make
                external code blend and work with my own. I am happy I kept this app simple as I experimented with many new concepts which could have made things
                very complcated for me. Overall, I am happy that the app fulfills its purpose and I am happy that I got exposure to many React concepts.
