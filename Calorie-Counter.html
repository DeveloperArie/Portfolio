                With this project I tried to make an application that could connect to an external API to retreive relevant calorie information
                from different food items searched. Along with this I used Chart.js and React Calandar to assist the user in keeping track of how many calories
                they are consuiming on a daily basis. The functionality I gave the calandar was to keep track of the items added which could be seen in the list section
                given the day that the user clicks on. The chart keeps track of the days the user has added items to and will display the total amount of calories
                eaten for that day along with the calorie limit that the user has set.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was one of my first projects where I used the React framework to design the structure of a site. I'm still pretty new to React so
                dealing with components and passing props felt a bit tricky at first. However, as the app was being put together, I found that dealing with
                components was an organized way of structuring code. Styling the app was actually the hardest part for me because the chart and calandar components
                came with their own CSS that I was not too familiar with at the time so I tried to style it enough to achieve a minimum viable product (MVP).
